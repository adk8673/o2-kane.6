Project 6

Fall 2018

This project includes two executables oss and user.  Oss can be invoked from the command line using the syntax ./oss. It will spawn off user children, up to a max, and then grant requests from them
for memory access.  
A log is kept in the file oss.log (up to a maximum number of files)
The option -n can be used to specifiy a maxmimum number of children (it can't exceed the value of MAX_PROCESSES defined in constants)
The option -h can be used to display help information.

Issues: In order to display the full range of behaviors, I used slightly different constant values for time intervals and number of frames.  Some of the stats also appear to be rounded off when displayed.

Source control was used.  The project is hosted at github.  The commit logs can be seen at:
